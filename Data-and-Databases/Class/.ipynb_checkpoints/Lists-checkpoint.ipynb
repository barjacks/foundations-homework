    "Let's start with a very high-level description of how computer programming works. When you're writing a computer program, you're describing to the computer what you want, and then asking the computer to figure that thing out for you. Your description of what you want is called an *expression*. The process that the computer uses to turn your expression into whatever that expression means is called *evaluation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a science fiction movie where a character asks the computer, out loud, \"What's the square root of nine billion?\" or \"How many people older than 50 live in Paris, France?\" Those are examples of expressions. The process that the computer uses to transform those expressions into a response is evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the process of evaluation is complete, you're left with a single \"value\". Think of it schematically like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Expression (you write this) -> Evaluation (the computer does this) -> Value (the resulting output)\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes computer programs powerful is that they make it possible to write very precise and sophisticated expressions. And importantly, you can embed the results of evaluating one expression inside of another expression, or save the results of evaluating an expression for later in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, computers can't understand and intuit your desires simply from a verbal description. That's why we need computer programming languages: to give us a way to write expressions in a way that the computer can understand. Because programming languages are designed to be precise, they can also be persnickety (and frustrating). And every programming language is different. It's tricky, but worth it."
