      "it is a sad day when members of congress try to manipulate compassion evoked by the national tragedy in my state of louisiana caused by katrina to pass a civil rights repeal in head start or jeopardize the passage of this law so important to the children of my state and our nation . \r\n",
      "i know , firsthand , that head start is a model for demonstrating that a strong prohibition on religious employment discrimination with federal funds is fully compatible with federal assistance to faith-based charities . \r\n",
      "faith-based organizations , like the ones i oversee , can and do fully participate in federally funded programs without discriminating in hiring with those same federal funds . \r\n",
      "i see no reason to change the law to allow them to use federal funds to discriminate against our employees . \r\n",
      "my state 's religiously affiliated providers are more than capable and willing to honor the civil rights requirements of the head start program . \r\n",
      "i am greatly concerned that the provision to remove civil rights protections for employees could have a negative impact on the children and families who participate in these programs . \r\n",
      "tens of thousands of at-risk 3- and 4-year-old children currently in head start could lose their teachers -- who often are the most important adults to whom they have bonded , other than their parents -- not because those teachers are doing a bad job , but because they are the `` wrong '' religion . \r\n",
      "as the state president of the louisiana head start association , i urge you to reject the boustany amendment to allow discrimination in head start . \r\n",
      "such a provision is incompatible with the mission of this program . \r\n",

      "we appreciate the bi-partisan spirit that has occurred throughout this crafting of the reauthorization bill . \r\n",
      "h.r. 2123 does not contain the controversial block grant proposal of the 108th congress and maintains the crucial comprehensive services of the head start program performance standards . \r\n",
      "we applaud a number of measures and improvements incorporated into this bill , such as enhanced homeless outreach ; greater set asides for migrant and seasonal workers and native americans , as well as early head start programs ; and the addition of a `` seamless service '' provision that allows programs to convert head start slots to early head start slots under certain circumstances . \r\n",
      "while the recompetition provision is not perfect , we appreciate that its intent is not to recompete all programs , but to recompete only failing programs . \r\n",

      "while we generally are pleased with the overall intent and direction of h.r. 2123 , we do have continuing concerns about certain specific provisions that we hope that can be resolved before the bill is enacted into law . \r\n",
      "these concerns are discussed in greater detail below . \r\n",
      "recompetition procedures , which are laid out in detail in section 641 ( c ) ( 1 ) - ( 19 ) include several areas that are problematic . \r\n",
      "while we strongly agree that programs that are not providing high quality services should have to recompete for head start funds , we are concerned that the language in this section may force more programs -- regardless of quality -- to undergo recompetition . \r\n",
      "we believe that there should be a strong message that all programs must be high performing . \r\n",
      "yet , we also believe that programs that are providing high quality services should not be put in the position of recompeting every five years , as this instability makes it difficult for them to recruit and retain the best teachers , to invest in facilities , and to create lasting partnerships with other community agencies . \r\n",
      "while we appreciate the efforts to make the recompetition process fair , there remains a very long list of tests that must be met to determine the priority status of programs . \r\n",
      "we continue to have concerns that some of these tests could be evaluated in an arbitrary manner , throwing programs into a recompete status , regardless of their performance . \r\n",
      "the head start community does not want to see failing programs continue , but we would like reassurances that the recompetition process will be unbiased and consistent in its application by the bureau . \r\n",
      "to achieve this , we would prefer that there be more limited parameters to determine the need to recompete a grantee , such as programs that have unresolved areas of noncompliance . \r\n",
      "the entire head start community is committed to raising the bar when it comes to improving quality and enhancing teacher and staff credentials . \r\n",
      "additionally , educational levels among head start teachers have increased appreciably since the 1998 congressional mandate to increase the proportion of head start teachers with an a.a . \r\n",
      "degree . \r\n",
      "fifty-seven percent of head start teachers had at least an a.a . \r\n",

      "in particular , we are seriously concerned about a statement released by the committee on education and the workforce on may 5 , 2005 , in which chairman boehner stated that he foresees an amendment on the house floor to rollback longstanding critical civil rights protections . \r\n",

      "further , any attempt to politicize the head start program -- a federally sponsored preschool program conceived to meet the needs of disadvantaged children since 1965 -- through a floor amendment to add the highly controversial religious exemption language , is not only unnecessary , but a sad commentary on the state of those political leaders who seek to attach religious exemption language to every social service program that comes before the congress . \r\n",
      "the interfaith alliance is pleased with the bipartisan direction of the head start legislation however ; this bill will no longer be bipartisan if there is any attempt to roll back longstanding critical civil rights protections . \r\n",
      "the civil rights protections afforded to head start teachers and staff are vital and should not be dislodged . \r\n",

      "as the school readiness act of 2005 ( h.r. 2123 ) moves to the house floor for a vote this week , we hope that you will use this time as an opportunity to improve the quality of head start programs that serve low-income children nationwide . \r\n",
      "since its inception in 1965 , the head start program has enrolled more than 22 million children . \r\n",
      "head start provides an array of comprehensive services to low-income parents and children that they may not otherwise have access to on their own . \r\n",
      "head start not only prepares children for school by providing a solid foundation in cognitive learning and socialization skills , but also helps make children `` ready to learn '' by providing comprehensive health , dental , and nutritional services critically needed by our at-risk children . \r\n",
      "seiu is committed to ensuring that children who participate in head start acquire the skills that prepare them for healthy , successful lives . \r\n",
      "this goal will not be realized unless certain steps are taken to improve the head start program . \r\n",
      "the head start bill passed by the house education and workforce committee contains several provisions that we support including greater set asides for migrant and seasonal workers and native americans , as well as early head start programs . \r\n",
      "however , seiu remains concerned about a number of provisions that may erode the quality of head start programs if not modified . \r\n",
      "we have outlined those concerns below . \r\n",
      "seiu supports continuing education for head start staff ; however , the bill 's requirement for additional training and education for head start staff may not become reality without the quality improvement funding to make the plan attainable . \r\n",
      "while seiu supports additional training and education for staff , we believe more funds also need to be provided for that training and education . \r\n",
      "head start teachers on average make $ 23 , 564 annually . \r\n",
      "further , there are no current incentives to retain highly qualified staff in head start programs after attaining degrees . \r\n",
      "additionally , head start needs sufficient resources to ensure every eligible child can participate and to increase the quality of programs . \r\n",
      "two out of five preschool children ( about 800 , 000 ) and 97 percent of infants and toddlers who qualify for early head start can not participate in the program simply because there are not enough resources invested in the program . \r\n",
      "we support full funding for head start so all eligible children have access to the head start program . \r\n",
      "also , the bill 's re-competition provisions need improvement . \r\n",
      "seiu is encouraged that the house bill does not require automatic re-competition for every grantee after the end of their grant period . \r\n",
      "however , the bill does require re-competition for grantees that have a `` deficiency '' during their grant period -- regardless of whether the deficiency has been resolved or not . \r\n",
      "in addition , the secretary has broad authority in identifying what a `` deficiency '' is , the finding of which would require programs to re-compete their grants . \r\n",
      "such uncertainty for all programs -- even those with stellar records of performance -- is counterproductive and would end programs ' ability to do any long-range planning . \r\n",
      "in the event a grantee is unsuccessful in a re-competition , seiu continues to have concerns for existing head start workers who may be displaced by re-competition . \r\n",
      "services and care-giving relationships for children should not be disrupted . \r\n",
      "moreover , seiu supports parental involvement in head start programs and encourages members of congress to re-think its plan to diminish the role of policy councils . \r\n",
      "policy councils offer real parental involvement regarding personnel and budgets . \r\n",
      "despite the advantages of parental involvement , the house bill changes governance responsibility to the board of directors , with policy councils playing only an advisory or consulting role . \r\n",
      "instead , congress should recognize that parents provide valuable insight into head start programs and can provide the necessary oversight of head start programs when armed with the proper training . \r\n",
      "seiu supports parental involvement through policy councils . \r\n",
      "finally , seiu vigorously opposes attempts to include language that would repeal longstanding civil rights protections that prohibit religious-based employment discrimination by head start agencies . \r\n",
      "the house bill currently maintains a provision designed to protect over 198 , 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 , 450 , 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination . \r\n",
      "this decades old civil rights provision has worked effectively since the inception of this program , allowing religious organizations to participate while maintaining constitutional civil and employment protections . \r\n",
      "the bill has gained broad support among diverse advocacy organizations , but that support will end if there is a successful effort to remove those protections in head start when the bill goes to the floor . \r\n",

      "we are especially pleased that the committee 's bipartisan bill maintains the integrity of the head start program and the quality performance standards that have helped head start successfully serve over 22 million children since the program began . \r\n",
      "we are extremely concerned , however , about a religious discrimination amendment that will be offered when the bill comes to the house floor . \r\n",
      "this unwarranted amendment would repeal the important civil rights protections that currently exist in head start that protect teachers and volunteers working in any head start program run by a religious organization . \r\n",

      "cdf acknowledges the continuing contribution of faith-based individuals and organizations , which have been the backbone of head start since its inception and have historically embraced serving our most vulnerable children when few others would even consider it . \r\n",
      "the religious discrimination provision , however , strikes at the very core of civil rights issues that so many of these individuals fought to secure . \r\n",
      "it is imperative that faith-based organizations be subject to the same civil rights laws that all programs who receive federal funding must abide by . \r\n",
      "the following are concerns raised by the amendment : teachers and staff could be hired based on their religion rather than their qualifications . \r\n",
      "tens of thousands of already at-risk 3- and 4-year-old children could lose their head start teachers , who often are the most important adults , other than their parents , with whom they have established meaningful relationships . \r\n",
      "head start has been an important source of employment for countless parents , but this provision could result in numerous parents losing their jobs , preventing families of head start children from climbing the ladder out of poverty . \r\n",
      "many head start volunteers are also parents . \r\n",
      "parent involvement has played a critical role in the success of head start . \r\n",
      "these volunteers could be let go as well if the provision passes . \r\n",
      "head start is a critical program for our country 's most vulnerable young children , providing them with valuable tools for future success in life . \r\n",
      "we are greatly concerned that removing civil rights protections for employees and volunteers would be detrimental to the children and families who benefit from this program . \r\n",
      "what message does this send to the head start children when their teachers , staff , and parents are denied opportunities in head start , simply because they do not share the federally-funded employers ' religious beliefs ? \r\n",
      "while substantial progress has been made creating a bipartisan bill with many positive provisions , the addition of a religious discrimination amendment would require cdf to oppose h.r. 2123 . \r\n",

      "we are particularly concerned with statements made by chairman john boehner ( r-oh ) which indicate that his clear intention is to offer an amendment on the floor adding language to reverse the non-discrimination provisions currently in effect in the head start program . \r\n",
      "we do not believe it should be legal to discriminate with federal funds . \r\n",

      "if an amendment is added on the floor which would roll back these civil rights protections , we urge you to oppose final passage of the school readiness act ( h.r. 2123 ) . \r\n",
      "as the nation 's largest gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender civil rights organization , we oppose using federal funds to discriminate on any basis , including religion , which unfortunately has been used as a proxy for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity . \r\n",
      "two prominent cases illustrate this problem : bellmore v. united methodist children 's home and department of human resources of georgia and pedreira v. kentucky baptist homes for children . \r\n",
      "further , we are particularly concerned that any provisions that allow federally funded religious discrimination will pre-empt local and state non-discrimination laws that include sexual orientation and gender identity . \r\n",
      "while we do not hold a position on the overall legislation , we have serious concerns with a provision that we understand will be offered on the floor that would roll back civil rights protections that have been in place and working effectively since 1972 . \r\n",
      "by abandoning these non-discrimination protections , head start providers would be able to discriminate on the basis of religion in federally funded positions , even when engaging in purely secular early childhood education activities . \r\n",
      "faith-based organizations have been partnering successfully with the government for a number of years without the need to bypass civil rights laws in their efforts to provide social services . \r\n",

      "the bill approved 48-0 by the house committee on education and the workforce that reaches the house floor is the product of many months of hard work resulting in a strong bipartisan agreement . \r\n",
      "it maintains critical civil rights protections in head start , preventing religious discrimination in federally funded head start positions . \r\n",
      "any attempts to amend the bill and repeal these protections threaten not only the bipartisan spirit of the bill , but the integrity of the head start program itself . \r\n",
      "if the promised boehner amendment passes , we urge you to vote `` no '' to h.r. 2123 . \r\n",
      "we are disappointed that an otherwise acceptable bill could be jeopardized with such an unwise amendment . \r\n",
      "we represent a diverse array of religions , covering the political and ideological spectrum . \r\n",
      "we stand united to oppose this unwarranted attack on a vital civil rights provision that protects over 1.6 million teachers and parent volunteers from having to choose between their religion and their participation in the local head start program . \r\n",
      "the bipartisan bill that passed unanimously out of the committee on education and the workforce has the potential to garner support from a broad range of groups , including all of the religious groups on this letter , but not if the proposed language is included . \r\n",
      "as religious institutions , we support preserving the autonomy of religious organizations with respect to hiring decisions made in privately funded programs . \r\n",
      "however , we also recognize the importance of ensuring that taxpayer dollars do not fund positions connected with the operation of the program itself where candidates may be disqualified because of the religion they practice . \r\n",
      "the longstanding nondiscrimination provision included in head start legislation since 1972 strikes the appropriate balance between religious autonomy and nondiscrimination . \r\n",
      "for over three decades , as religious and religiously affiliated organizations , we strive to make the world a better place for the next generation and generations to follow . \r\n",
      "the head start program is an extremely successful government funded means of achieving this goal , providing opportunities for nearly one million at-risk children each year . \r\n",
      "we urge you to oppose any effort , such as rep . \r\n",
      "boehner 's planned floor amendment , to change this crucial program by stripping its civil rights protections and allowing providers to discriminate on religious grounds . \r\n",
      "thank you for your consideration of this important matter . \r\n",
      "respectfully , omb watch , washington , dc , september 16 , 2005 . \r\n",
      "dear representative : omb watch strongly urges you to oppose the any attempt to include `` charitable choice '' provisions in the head start program , which would allow religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of the religion when hiring for federally funded programs . \r\n",
      "religious organizations play a meaningful role in the delivery of social service programs . \r\n",
      "we do not question the right of religious organizations to participate in federal programs , nor their ability to avail themselves of an exemption under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 that allows religious organizations to hire co-religionists with their own money . \r\n",
      "however , we do question whether federal dollars should fund discrimination by the very few religious organizations that refuse to follow the same rules that all other organizations participating in federal programs follow . \r\n",
      "although religious employers have the right under title vii to apply religious tests to employees , the constitution requires that the direct receipt and administration of federal funds remove that exemption . \r\n",
      "in addition , the federal government has constitutional obligations reinforced by chief justice rehnquist 's majority opinion in bowen v. kendrick , 487 u.s. 589 ( 1988 ) . \r\n",
      "the court stated that although the constitution does not bar religious organizations from participating in federal programs , it requires ( 1 ) that no one participating in a federal program can `` discriminate on the basis of religion '' and ( 2 ) that all federal programs must be carried out in a `` lawful , secular manner. '' id . \r\n",
      "at 609 , 612 . \r\n",
      "faith-based and secular grantees face high standards and must be treated equally . \r\n",
      "the acceptance of federal funds -- taxpayer money -- should require all recipients to practice non-discrimination in hiring as it relates to those funds . \r\n",
      "i urge you to maintain the integrity of religious grantees and prevent government-funded religious discrimination by opposing any attempt to include `` charitable choice '' provisions into the head start program . \r\n",
      "if you have any questions , please contact jennifer lowe at 202-234-8494 . \r\n",
      "thank you for your attention to this matter . \r\n",
